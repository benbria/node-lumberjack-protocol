# Connects to a lumberjack receiver and sends messages.
#
# `Client` connects to the lumberjack receiver in the background and will automatically reconnect
# if the connection is lost.  Messages sent to the `Client` while disconnected will be queued
# and sent automatically once the connection is re-established.
#
# Emits:
# * `connect` when the Client connects to the receiver.
#
# * `disconnect(err)` when the client disconnects from the receiver, or when the client fails to
#   connect to the receiver.  `err` will be the error which caused the disconnect, if there is one.
#   The Client will automatically reconnect.
#
# * `dropped(count)` if messages are dropped because the receiver is not acknowledging messages
#   fast enough.
#
class Client extends EventEmitter

    # * `tlsConnectOptions` are options used to connect to the receiver.  Any options which can be
    #   passed to `tls.connect()` can be passed here.
    #
    # * `options.windowSize` - passed on to the ClientSocket.
    #
    # * `options.maxQueueSize` - the maximum number of messages to queue while disconnected.
    #   If this limit is hit, all messages in the queue will be filtered with
    #   `options.allowDrop(data)`.  Only messages which this function returns true for will be
    #   removed from the queue.  If there are still too many messages in the queue at this point
    #   the the oldest messages will be dropped.  Defaults to 500.
    #
    # * `options.allowDrop(data)` - this will be called when deciding which messages to drop.
    #   By dropping lower priority messages (info and debug level messages, for example) you can
    #   increase the chances of higher priority messages getting through when the Client is
    #   having connection issues, or if the receiver goes down for a short period of time.
    #
    # * `options.reconnect` - time, in ms, to wait between reconnect attempts.  Defaults to 3
    #   seconds.
    #
    # * `options.unref` - if true, will call [unref](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_unref) on the
    #   underlying socket.  This will allow the program to exit if this is the only active socket in the event system.
